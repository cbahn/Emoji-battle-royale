emoji-battle-royale
================

A golang webserver I'm using to host a battle royale style voteoff for emojis on my discord

Work in progress

    $ go run webserver.go
    
... and point a browser at http://localhost:8097/home
which returns an HTML webpage (home.html).

Thanks to https://github.com/jimmahoney/golang-webserver for the awesome example server for me to start from
